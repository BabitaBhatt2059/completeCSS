        <h1> About Mother</h1>
        A mother is a female parent who has given birth to or raised a child. The role of a mother includes providing physical and emotional care for her child, as well as helping to shape the child's values and beliefs. The bond between a mother and her child is often considered to be one of the strongest emotional connections in human relationships.
