        <h1>How plane crashes</h1>
        There are many factors that can contribute to a plane crash, including mechanical failure, pilot error, adverse weather conditions, and sabotage or terrorism.

Mechanical failure can occur due to a variety of issues, such as a malfunctioning engine, faulty navigation equipment, or a structural failure of the aircraft.

Pilot error can also lead to a crash, such as if a pilot becomes disoriented or makes a poor judgment call. Weather conditions such as icing, turbulence, or thunderstorms can also be a major factor in a crash.

Sabotage or terrorist attacks can also cause a plane crash.

In order to prevent plane crashes, aircraft are regularly inspected and maintained, and pilots are required to undergo rigorous training and testing. Air traffic controllers also play a critical role in ensuring the safety of flights by directing aircraft to avoid dangerous weather conditions and potential collisions. Despite all of these safety measures, accidents can still happen.
